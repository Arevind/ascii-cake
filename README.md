## ✨ What is this?  

`ascii-cake` is a **birthday celebration in your terminal**.  
Think: 🎆 ASCII fireworks, 🎵 background music, 💌 scrolling letters, 🎭 fake "hacker" verifications, and a lot of fun styling via [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich).  

If you want to surprise someone nerdy (or yourself 😅), just run this script and let the magic unfold.

## 🎇 Features  

- **Fake scripts + verification quiz** 🕵️ – You need to "hack" your way in.  
- **Fireworks animation** 🎆 – Terminal-based explosions in full color.  
- **ASCII cake & visuals** 🍰 – Because birthdays need art.  
- **Background music** 🎵 – Plays via `pygame` if available, otherwise simulates sound.  
- **Scrolling birthday letter** 💌 – Slowly reveals a personal message.  
- **Finale celebration screen** 🎉 – Emojis, confetti vibes, and a warm goodbye.

## 🎵 Music

- Default file name: `music.mp3`

- If not found, the app switches to simulation mode 🎶 (fake notes in the console).

- You can drop in any `.mp3` you like.

## 🎁 Why did I build this?

Because sometimes a git repo can be a gift.
This is a small, chaotic, terminal-based way of saying:

"Happy Birthday, you beautiful nerd." 💖

## 🚀 Future Add-ons (if I ever stop celebrating)

-  Text-to-Speech birthday wishes

-  Customizable quizzes

-  Extra ASCII animations (balloons, cake candles, etc.)

##  Author

Built with too much coffee ☕ and a questionable sense of humor by Arevind Mohan.

## 🎉 Final Words

Run it, share it, fork it.
Make someone’s day better with a little terminal confetti.

🎂  🎈  🎁  ✨  🌟  💖  🎊  🥳
